# FLTR
- Create user contract material delta tracker (Possibly for future contract manager)
- ~~Implement Auto-formatting where relevant~~
- Implement ability to delete items from route (or clear route)
- Finalise Route Dialog Functionality

# PDM
- ~~Create function that returns the game-format of the location string you used (turns hrt -> HRT)~~

# DSC
- Show Total tonnage and volume of currently loaded shipment
- Overhaul UI to match FLTR
- Deprecate use of MaterialDisplay; Instead utilise a custom widget and mimick the FLTR setup.
